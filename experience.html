    I’ve started to do part-time job when I was 18 while waiting for my SPM’s result. One of purposes I work on a part time basis is to get out of my comfort zone such as improve my communication skill, time management skill, and improve my finance management. 
At Coolblog, I worked as a waitress. My communication skills increased significantly because I was always approaching customers and conversing with them in a non-sequential manner. For example, prior to this, I was too afraid to approach strangers. I'm unable to make eye contact with everyone I've spoken with.

    During the last semester's break, I started my second part-time job. I keep choosing waitressing as a part-time career because I enjoy serving people and believe it is a very simple profession for me. In the city where I live, I work in one of the city's most well-known cafes. Nina Café is the name of the restaurant. Everyone will enjoy the cafe. This is due to the fact that this cafe is relatively quiet and ideal for a proper meal, lunch with colleagues, or breakfast with friends.

Last but not least, when I make mistakes, my manager always offers me sensible advice. She never chastised me without first inquiring about it.
This is a memory I was able to capture with my manager while working at her cafe.
